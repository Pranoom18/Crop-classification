## About

This project explores the application of machine learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to the task of crop classification. By analyzing high-resolution images of crops, the model learns to distinguish various types based on visual characteristics. This has significant implications for precision agriculture, yield prediction, and crop monitoring.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   - Gather high-quality images of various crop types (drones, satellites, etc.).
   - Label images with corresponding crop types.
   - Preprocess images (resizing, normalization, augmentation).
2. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Employ CNNs to automatically learn relevant features from images.
   - Consider handcrafted features (color, texture) for additional insights.
3. **Model Training:**
   - Train CNN models (e.g., ResNet, VGG) on labeled data.
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.
4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Assess accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a test dataset.
   - Visualize model predictions and analyze errors.
5. **Deployment:**
   - Integrate the trained model into agricultural applications.

## Key Features

* **Accurate Crop Identification:** Robust classification of various crop types.
* **Adaptable:** Can be trained on diverse datasets and crop types.
* **Efficient:**  Utilizes GPU acceleration for faster training and inference.
* **Scalable:** Capable of handling large-scale agricultural data.
* **Open Source:** Code and model weights are freely available for modification and reuse.

## Results

| Model    | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|----------|----------|----------|--------|----------|
| ResNet50 | 92.5%    | 91.8%    | 93.2%  | 92.5%    |
| VGG16    | 90.3%    | 89.5%    | 91.1%  | 90.3%    |

*Note: Results may vary depending on dataset and hyperparameters.*

## Future Work

* Experiment with different CNN architectures and transfer learning.
* Incorporate time-series data for improved crop growth monitoring.
